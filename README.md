# Node Demo

Printing "Hello World" to the console and to a file.

```sh
$ npm start

> hellonode@1.0.0 start
> node index.js

Hello world
Write completed
```

Hello world is printed first and the Write completes after because it executes asynchronously.

NODE REPL

```sh
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v16.14.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
> console.log('Hello world');
Hello world
undefined
> 
```
